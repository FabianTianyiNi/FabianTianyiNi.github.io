I am an graduate student of Linguistics in the Department of English at Arizona State University. I also have a Master in Computer Science from [Arizona State University](www.asu.edu), and a Master of Science in Statistics in the [Department of Mathematics](https://statistics.arizona.edu/) at [the University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). At ASU, I participated in the Syntax Research Group, which focuses on the theoretical research on Syntax of human language. My research is focused on variation across human languages, specifically in the domains of syntax (sentence structure) and morphology (word structure). I am also interested in using computational methods to process human languages and simulate the language change, e.g., Computational/Statistical Historical Linguistics and Computational Language Revitalization. Computation, Neuroscience, Brain and Mind will always drive my research forward.

Regarding language revitalization, I am working with [Athabaskan language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabaskan_languages), especially Northern Athabaskan languages in Alaska and British Columbia, Canada, which are also the languages I like to use when I am doing my syntax research. Besides, old languages, such as Old English and Old Norse, are not only beautiful in literature but also useful to learn and make us know how did they change throughout the history of human beings.

Academically, I am only using human languages to carry out my researches. But the other part of me likes to figure out [Xenolinguistics](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life/Xenolinguistics).
